I followed this project from the youtuber "Alex The Analyst"

With this SQL project, I learned how to... 
- Organize complex queries using CTEs and temporary tables.
- Create reusable database objects like views for consistent and efficient data retrieval
- Select and filter data based on specific conditions.
- Perform calculations on numerical data to derive meaningful metrics
- Group and aggregate data to summarize it effectively.
